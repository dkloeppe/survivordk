        <title>First 25 Days on Ragnarok</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello and Welcome! I’m SurvivorDK, and I play Ark: Survival Evolved (2015). Ark is an action-adventure, open-world, survival, crafting game. I started this channel in 2023 because I enjoy playing this game and I wanted to learn video editing. So far, I’ve made 27 videos, and I’ve gotten 7 subscribers! There was a lot for me to learn, from recording with OBS, to fixing my audio in Audacity, to finding royalty-free-music, to editing in OpenShot and KDenLive, to actually playing the game and making progress! I’ve really enjoyed every step of the way though!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZbcuQyXHt0BtUqhAQ2c2QQ&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/first-17-days/ark-ragnarok-banner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ark Ragnarok&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;...</description>

Ark is an action-adventure, open-world, survival, crafting game where you can tame dinos, build bases, and fight bosses. I started my YouTube channel (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@SurvivorDK&quot;&gt;@SurvivorDK&lt;/a&gt;) in 2023 because I enjoy playing this game and I wanted to learn video editing. I have two main goals for my first Ragnarok series: tame every dino and beat the boss! There are 110 tameable creatures on this map, so that’s going to be quite the feat!
