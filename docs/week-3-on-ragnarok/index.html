                <p>Welcome back survivors! It’s week 3 on Ragnarok, and I’m going to be building some awesome traps. This will help me reach my goal of taming every creature on this map. During my first week, I made great progress leveling-up and taming starter dinos.  My thatch hut was quickly upgraded to wood, and I crafted all the base essentials as I unlocked more engrams.</p>

<p>Over the course of my second week on Ragnarok, I expanded my tribe and resources significantly. Starting on day 8, I gathered Flint, Stone, and Metal with Thorny and tamed several new creatures, including Lavender, Sandy, Blaze, and Marigold, bringing my total to 24 tamed dinos. I started day 9 with a metal run and crafted some large storage boxes. I also tamed two Tek Parasaurs: Sapphire and Topaz, and Perry the Pteranodon, my first flier. On day 10, I continued hunting for keratin and tamed Terry the Pteranodon.  Days 11 and 12 were focused on resource gathering and taming more dinos like more Pteranodons and a Tek Stego. I did some exploring along Viking Coast and encountered a few pesky Vultures on the way. Day 13 involved a challenging journey after a death, but I managed to retrieve my gear and avenge my fallen pet. By day 14, I constructed a stone barn and improved my survival stats. Through various challenges, my tribe grew stronger, and I prepared for greater adventures with my new fliers.</p>

<h3 id="day-15-crafting-and-the-leggo-memorial-rex-trap">Day 15: Crafting and the Leggo Memorial Rex Trap</h3>

<p>The sun rose on day 15, casting its light over Viking Bay, where I had started building my base two weeks ago. I kicked off the morning by harvesting berries with Stacey. After admiring the sunrise, I crafted several stacks of narcotic, two longneck rifles, ammo, and my first set of flak armor. Thorny the Anky and I gathered flint and stone, allowing me to craft stone arrows in preparation for taming a Level 85 Rex. The stone pillars were too heavy for Terry, so Berry followed with the supplies.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/week-03/Day-15-Rex-Trap-Cropped.png" alt="Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 15 - Rex Pillar Trap - @captainfatdog" /></p>

<p>I decided to build the trap on the beach near the cliff where Leggo had died, naming it the Leggo Memorial Rex Trap. Thanks to Captain Fatdog’s easy design, building the trap was a success, despite some issues with Terry and Berry’s following distance. I managed to lure the Rex into the trap on the first try. However my crossbow broke mid-taming. I had to fly back to base to repair it, and then returned to knock-out the trapped Rex. The sun had just fished setting when I finally knocked-out the Rex. After hunting brontos in the dark for raw prime meat, I fed the it to the Rex. Rain fell as I waited for the Rex to finish taming. I named him Cliff when he woke up on the morning of day 16.</p>

<p>Here’s the full episode for day 15: <a href="https://youtu.be/ujqowVMiZk0"><img src="/assets/img/week-03/Day-15-Rex-Trap-Thumbnail-v2.png" alt="Taming a Rex!" /></a></p>

<h3 id="day-16-taming-and-tranq-darts">Day 16: Taming and Tranq Darts</h3>

<p>With the rain gone, I returned to base to craft narcotics and tranq darts, having reached level 62. A yellow drop yielded an Apprentice Sabertooth Saddle and a Ramshackle Sword blueprint. Cliff, now my first tame of Week 3, had decent health and melee stats, at least for my first Rex.  I’d like to go after some higher level ones later.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/week-03/Day-16-Doedicurus.png" alt="Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 16 - Tranqing a Doedicurus" /></p>

<p>I spotted a level 50 male Doedicurus that had killed me on day 13. Armed with my longneck rifle and tranq darts, I smoothly knocked him out.  However I forgot berries for the taming, so I flew back to base to grab a couple stacks. After feeding the Doedic, I waited for him to tame up, which he did by the morning of day 17. I named him Sandstone.</p>

<h3 id="day-17-an-argy-trap-on-a-cliff">Day 17: An Argy Trap on a Cliff</h3>

<p>I started day 17 by harvesting narcoberries and crafting a Doedicurus saddle. A purple ring drop near my base provided a Gallimimus saddle and a blueprint for a terror bird saddle. With Sandstone ready to harvest stone, I planned to build an Argentavis trap using another of Captain Fatdog’s designs. The trap was set up on the cliff above the Leggo Memorial Rex Trap, an area with abundant Argentavis spawns.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/week-03/Day-17-Trapped-Argy.png" alt="Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 17 - Taming an Argy!" /></p>

<p>I trapped a level 100 female Argentavis, knocking her out with tranq darts from my longneck rifle. As I waited for the Argy to tame up, I hunted the other Argy’s in the area for raw prime meat and talons. As the sun set, I welcomed Marge the Argentavis as my third tame of the week.</p>

<h3 id="day-18-another-argentavis-and-doedicurus">Day 18: Another Argentavis and Doedicurus</h3>

<p>Day 18 began with a plan to tame another Doedicurus and Argentavis. I spotted a level 130 Argy near the trap and started the taming process. I reached level 66 while hunting for raw prime meat for the new Argy. A dangerous encounter with a Rex had me calling Cliff for backup.  I finished the day by knocking out the pink Level 60 Doedic on the beach.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/week-03/Day-18-Argy.png" alt="Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 18 - Taming an Argy!" /></p>

<p>While waiting for the creatures to tame up, I flew back to base to craft more tranqs and prepare for taming a Baryonyx. I harvested some stone and metal with Thorny, then I gathered the necessary resources for a few cryopods and flew to the snow mountain to harvest last thing I needed: Organic Polymer from penguins. Crafting three cryo-pods at Blue Obelisk was a huge milestone. I continued taming, adding Ace the Argy and preparing for the Baryonyx.</p>

<h3 id="day-19-taming-challenges-and-perseverance">Day 19: Taming Challenges and Perseverance</h3>

<p>Day 19 was tough. While flying over the swamp, looking for a Baryonyx, I accidentally dismounted mid-air and fell to my death.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/week-03/Day-19-Death-1-Dismount.png" alt="Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 19 - First Death!" /></p>

<p>After respawning back at base, I hopped on Berry and started flying back to the swamp. I wasn’t paying attention to Berry’s stamina bar, and he ran out right next to an Allo!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/week-03/Day-19-Death-2-Stamina.png" alt="Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 19 - Second Death!" /></p>

<p>While in a state of panic, I dismounted again, and fell to my death AGAIN. With no more saddled fliers at my disposal, I rode Fire with Marge following until I gathered enough Chitin to craft an Argy saddle.</p>

<h3 id="day-20-successful-swamp-stunt">Day 20: Successful Swamp Stunt</h3>

<p>I was eventually able to harvest enough Chitin to craft an Argy saddle, so I picked up Fire and flew to the Leggo Memorial Rex Trap.  I decided to let Fire hang out with Sandstone and Cliff as I went to go grab my death bags from yesterday.   Now it’s time to tame that Baryonyx!  I cryo’d up Terry and Berry, and put the trap structures on my hotbar.  I found a relatively safe spot to build the trap, and placed it down as quickly as I could.  Now I have to lure him over.</p>

<p>I successfully trapped and tranqed the Bary.  I had to dodge a Kapro and clear out a few nearby threats during the tranqing process, but these things happen in the swamp.  You need Regular Kibble or Fish Meat to tame a Baryonyx. It can be raw or cooked fish meat, and prime is more effective.  There are Piranha and Coelacanth (see-luh-kanth) in the water nearby, which I was able to harvest with Marge.  I spent the night harvesting raw fish meat, and protecting the knocked-out Baryonyx.</p>

<h3 id="day-21-preparing-for-future-adventures">Day 21: Preparing for Future Adventures</h3>

<p>On the morning of Day 21, I started knocking-out a Frog. I was able to knock him out right by the Baryonyx trap. I went hunting for some raw prime meat for taming the Frog. As I was feeding it to the Frog, the Baryonyx finished taming. I’m going to name him Striker. I cryo’d him up, and started flying back to base.  On the way, I picked up the new Doedicurus, which I’m gonna name Garnet.  I also picked up Fire and the new Argy, which I’m gonna name Ace.</p>

<p>When I got back to base, I crafted up some saddles and was disappointed by a purple drop. I also spent some time crafting stone foundations. I want to start expanding my base tomorrow!  I’m going to build a castle!</p>

<p>Well, that’s it for week 3 on Ragnarok!</p>

            "articleBody": "Welcome back survivors! It’s week 3 on Ragnarok, and I’m going to be building some awesome traps. This will help me reach my goal of taming every creature on this map. During my first week, I made great progress leveling-up and taming starter dinos.  My thatch hut was quickly upgraded to wood, and I crafted all the base essentials as I unlocked more engrams.

Over the course of my second week on Ragnarok, I expanded my tribe and resources significantly. Starting on day 8, I gathered Flint, Stone, and Metal with Thorny and tamed several new creatures, including Lavender, Sandy, Blaze, and Marigold, bringing my total to 24 tamed dinos. I started day 9 with a metal run and crafted some large storage boxes. I also tamed two Tek Parasaurs: Sapphire and Topaz, and Perry the Pteranodon, my first flier. On day 10, I continued hunting for keratin and tamed Terry the Pteranodon.  Days 11 and 12 were focused on resource gathering and taming more dinos like more Pteranodons and a Tek Stego. I did some exploring along Viking Coast and encountered a few pesky Vultures on the way. Day 13 involved a challenging journey after a death, but I managed to retrieve my gear and avenge my fallen pet. By day 14, I constructed a stone barn and improved my survival stats. Through various challenges, my tribe grew stronger, and I prepared for greater adventures with my new fliers.

Day 15: Crafting and the Leggo Memorial Rex Trap

The sun rose on day 15, casting its light over Viking Bay, where I had started building my base two weeks ago. I kicked off the morning by harvesting berries with Stacey. After admiring the sunrise, I crafted several stacks of narcotic, two longneck rifles, ammo, and my first set of flak armor. Thorny the Anky and I gathered flint and stone, allowing me to craft stone arrows in preparation for taming a Level 85 Rex. The stone pillars were too heavy for Terry, so Berry followed with the supplies.



I decided to build the trap on the beach near the cliff where Leggo had died, naming it the Leggo Memorial Rex Trap. Thanks to Captain Fatdog’s easy design, building the trap was a success, despite some issues with Terry and Berry’s following distance. I managed to lure the Rex into the trap on the first try. However my crossbow broke mid-taming. I had to fly back to base to repair it, and then returned to knock-out the trapped Rex. The sun had just fished setting when I finally knocked-out the Rex. After hunting brontos in the dark for raw prime meat, I fed the it to the Rex. Rain fell as I waited for the Rex to finish taming. I named him Cliff when he woke up on the morning of day 16.

Here’s the full episode for day 15: 

Day 16: Taming and Tranq Darts

With the rain gone, I returned to base to craft narcotics and tranq darts, having reached level 62. A yellow drop yielded an Apprentice Sabertooth Saddle and a Ramshackle Sword blueprint. Cliff, now my first tame of Week 3, had decent health and melee stats, at least for my first Rex.  I’d like to go after some higher level ones later.



I spotted a level 50 male Doedicurus that had killed me on day 13. Armed with my longneck rifle and tranq darts, I smoothly knocked him out.  However I forgot berries for the taming, so I flew back to base to grab a couple stacks. After feeding the Doedic, I waited for him to tame up, which he did by the morning of day 17. I named him Sandstone.

Here’s the full episode for day 16: 

Day 17: An Argy Trap on a Cliff

I started day 17 by harvesting narcoberries and crafting a Doedicurus saddle. A purple ring drop near my base provided a Gallimimus saddle and a blueprint for a terror bird saddle. With Sandstone ready to harvest stone, I planned to build an Argentavis trap using another of Captain Fatdog’s designs. The trap was set up on the cliff above the Leggo Memorial Rex Trap, an area with abundant Argentavis spawns.



I trapped a level 100 female Argentavis, knocking her out with tranq darts from my longneck rifle. As I waited for the Argy to tame up, I hunted the other Argy’s in the area for raw prime meat and talons. As the sun set, I welcomed Marge the Argentavis as my third tame of the week.

Here’s the full episode for day 17: 

Day 18: Another Argentavis and Doedicurus

Day 18 began with a plan to tame another Doedicurus and Argentavis. I spotted a level 130 Argy near the trap and started the taming process. I reached level 66 while hunting for raw prime meat for the new Argy. A dangerous encounter with a Rex had me calling Cliff for backup.  I finished the day by knocking out the pink Level 60 Doedic on the beach.



While waiting for the creatures to tame up, I flew back to base to craft more tranqs and prepare for taming a Baryonyx. I harvested some stone and metal with Thorny, then I gathered the necessary resources for a few cryopods and flew to the snow mountain to harvest last thing I needed: Organic Polymer from penguins. Crafting three cryo-pods at Blue Obelisk was a huge milestone. I continued taming, adding Ace the Argy and preparing for the Baryonyx.

Here’s the full episode for day 18: 

Day 19: Taming Challenges and Perseverance

Day 19 was tough. While flying over the swamp, looking for a Baryonyx, I accidentally dismounted mid-air and fell to my death.



After respawning back at base, I hopped on Berry and started flying back to the swamp. I wasn’t paying attention to Berry’s stamina bar, and he ran out right next to an Allo!



While in a state of panic, I dismounted again, and fell to my death AGAIN. With no more saddled fliers at my disposal, I rode Fire with Marge following until I gathered enough Chitin to craft an Argy saddle.

Here’s the full episode for day 19: 

Day 20: Successful Swamp Stunt

I was eventually able to harvest enough Chitin to craft an Argy saddle, so I picked up Fire and flew to the Leggo Memorial Rex Trap.  I decided to let Fire hang out with Sandstone and Cliff as I went to go grab my death bags from yesterday.   Now it’s time to tame that Baryonyx!  I cryo’d up Terry and Berry, and put the trap structures on my hotbar.  I found a relatively safe spot to build the trap, and placed it down as quickly as I could.  Now I have to lure him over.



I successfully trapped and tranqed the Bary.  I had to dodge a Kapro and clear out a few nearby threats during the tranqing process, but these things happen in the swamp.  You need Regular Kibble or Fish Meat to tame a Baryonyx. It can be raw or cooked fish meat, and prime is more effective.  There are Piranha and Coelacanth (see-luh-kanth) in the water nearby, which I was able to harvest with Marge.  I spent the night harvesting raw fish meat, and protecting the knocked-out Baryonyx.

Here’s the full episode for day 20: 

Day 21: Preparing for Future Adventures

On the morning of Day 21, I started knocking-out a Frog. I was able to knock him out right by the Baryonyx trap. I went hunting for some raw prime meat for taming the Frog. As I was feeding it to the Frog, the Baryonyx finished taming. I’m going to name him Striker. I cryo’d him up, and started flying back to base.  On the way, I picked up the new Doedicurus, which I’m gonna name Garnet.  I also picked up Fire and the new Argy, which I’m gonna name Ace.



When I got back to base, I crafted up some saddles and was disappointed by a purple drop. I also spent some time crafting stone foundations. I want to start expanding my base tomorrow!  I’m going to build a castle!

Well, that’s it for week 3 on Ragnarok!
