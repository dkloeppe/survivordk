Hello Survivors! Welcome back to Week 4 of my solo playthrough of Ark: Survival Evolved on Ragnarok. I'm making progress towards my goals of: taming all 110 creatures, beating the boss on all three difficulties, and building bases all over the map.

You can check out my YouTube channel here: [@SurvivorDK](https://www.youtube.com/@SurvivorDK)

This week, I’m going to start building a castle on the coast!

### Day 22: Treasure Hunting and Expanding my Base

At 5am on Day 22, I set off towards the swamp to pick up Billy the Frog. I’m flying on Margy the Argy, who isn’t very fast. I need to tame a Griffin soon! I’m level 74 now, which means I can unlock the Rex saddle!
As I flew by the Argy and Rex traps, I set up a small respawn outpost. Right now it’s just a single foundation with a bed and a storage chest,
but I’ll be expanding it soon. I continued towards the swamp on Marge, enjoying some amazing scenery on the way.
After checking on the frog, I built another little respawn outpost. I still need to put some useful items in the storage chests, but I’ll do that later. I grabbed Billy and started heading back to base. I stopped at the Leggo Memorial Rex Trap to pick up Cliff. I want to bring him back to base too.
As I neared my base on the Viking Coast, I spotted a yellow ring drop. I was trying to find the prompt to open the supply crate, when I accidentally fell off the cliff. The yellow drop had landed too far into the rock and was stuck in the mesh.
I make it back to base and throw out Cliff. Now my beach base has plenty of defense! Next it was time to focus on my grand project: building a castle! I’m building it up on the ledge overlooking my starter hut. I’ll be building a ramp down to the beach for quick access to the water.

Here's the design for the castle:

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 22 - Castle Foundation Shape!](/assets/img/first-25-days/Base-Sketch.jpg)

The castle foundation is: 48 stone foundations and 192 triangle stone foundations. I’m gonna place large stone walls all around the perimeter with three dinosaur gateways. The second level is going to have a hole in the middle so I can fly in and out of the base. Eventually, some of the six towers may go up to third and fourth levels.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 22 - Castle Foundation Start!](/assets/img/first-25-days/Day-22-Thumb.jpg)

After placing all of the foundations that I have crafted so far, I’m pretty pleased with the progress. There’s a lot more to do, but I think the placement of the castle is going to work perfectly! I decided to take a break from building and go check out the sunken ship in Viking Bay!
I don't have any scuba gear crafted yet, but I'm too curious to wait. I hop on Ace and start flying over! On the way I see a green drop!
Inside are some resources. I’ll be using those for building the castle, and I always need more narcotic! I see a red drop on the distant snow mountain, but decide not to go for it. It’ll probably disappear by the time I reach it, or I’ll die to the cold or wolves or something as I try to retrieve it. I’ll be crafting fur armor soon, then I can check out ice cave for those loot crates.

After landing on a rock in the middle of Viking bay, I threw out Striker. I like the Baryonyx spin attack that temporarily stuns most water creatures, but Striker’s doesn’t have that much stamina. I decided to not press my luck and go home. I want to craft some scuba gear before going back to the sunken ship. In order to do that, I’ll need to make a fabricator.

I made it back to base as the sun set on Day 22.

### Day 23: Castle Foundation

During the night, I spotted a purple drop that was close to base. I found a Ramshackle ghillie mask inside. When I got back to base, I spotted a pt egg, but I was blocked! It’ll be nice when I move most of the dinos up to the castle. I need to re-organize my base a bit; it's getting cluttered...

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 23 - Beach Starter Hut!](/assets/img/week-04/Day-23-Beach-Hut.jpg)

Today, I want to make more progress on the castle foundation! Yesterday, I only placed about a fifth of the foundation. I was able to harvest a lot of stone with Garnet the Doedicurus. Most of the morning was spent crafting stone foundations. Periodically I would have to harvest more stone and wood. I kept placing foundations down, slowly making my way around the perimeter. I also crafted sparkpowder, gunpowder, and some narcotics. Eventually, I finished the outer ring of the castle foundation.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 23 - Castle Foundation Perimeter!](/assets/img/week-04/Day-23-base-screenshot-2.jpg)

Just the center portion is left: 24 square and 48 triangle stone foundations. I’m 70% done with the foundation! I spent the evening gathering more resources for crafting stone building structures. During the night, I placed some feeding troughs and continued harvesting and crafting.

### Day 24: Swamp Misadventures

I struggled with building the ramp up to my castle.  I need to place stone stairs, ceilings, and pillars, but it’s a little finicky. I’m TRYING to build a ramp up to my castle, but I’m having a LITTLE difficulty. I spent the whole morning struggling with getting the ramp started.
Here’s what I’ve got right now.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 24 - Castle Entrance Stairs!](/assets/img/first-25-days/Day-24-stairs-2.jpg)

I’m NOT thrilled with how it’s going… I decided to give up on it for a little while, and work on something else. I spent a little time organizing the base, then I headed out on Ace. I want to try to tame another Baryonyx, so I’m going to the swamp. Things don’t go according to plan… But I do find a high level frog! I stopped by the Leggo Memorial Rex Trap to pick up Sandstone. I want to have BOTH Doed’s back at base for building. After doing that, I continued flying south towards the swamp.

When I got to the swamp, I expanded the trap that I had built. I also placed down a second trap. Then I continued the search. It’s not a Bary, but I definitely want to tame this level 145 frog. I want a high level frog for taking on the bug cave. After a few failed attempts to drop the frog into the trap, I did it on foot. Another frog spawned nearby, so I had to take care of it first. Once I got the Level 145 frog trapped, I started shooting tranqs until it was knocked out. I messed up the last shot, dropping the taming effectiveness a little. I decided to let the frog wake up to try again later. I’m hoping for some good stats on this one.

I continued searching for a high-level Baryonyx. After doing almost a full loop around the swamp, I spotted a Level 95 Male Baryonyx. I was contemplating luring him over to the trap, but I accidentally put my Argy in the water.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 24 - Epic Fail in the swamp while looking for a high-level Baryonyx!](/assets/img/first-25-days/Day-24-Epic-Fail.jpg)

I’m killed by a Kapro in the panic of my disastrous dismount.  I should really craft myself a pump shotty… I respawned at a nearby bed and began my death run attempts back to my bag. After failing several times, I decided to respawn all the way back at base. Then I took Terry back to the swamp and recovered my bags and Ace. Ace had taken out the Bary, so I'll keep looking for a higher-level one.

### Day 25: Taming a Beaver

In the early morning of day 25, I carefully re-tranq the frog that I had trapped yesterday. It’s a little before sunrise, so it’s still quite dark. I need to place some campfires and standing torches around the traps. Then I’ll be able to see better. After I knock out the frog, I hunt some nearby Paracers for their raw prime meat. The frog started taming pretty quickly since her food bar had gone down a bit. The frog tamed up to level 217! I’m pretty happy with the stats. Health and Melee went up quite a bit, and Movement Speed doubled! Lilly is going to be great for caving! 

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 25 - Lilly the Frog!](/assets/img/first-25-days/Day-25-Lilly-the-Frog.jpg)

At 5am on day 25, I brought Lilly back to base. I had left a bunch of supplies in a crate by my swamp bed. Now I can fast-travel over to the swamp and have some gear. Or use it as a spare kit if I die, which will probably happen eventually. The swamp is pretty dangerous. On the way home, I also left some supplies and a PT at the respawn outpost by the Leggo Memorial Rex Trap. I’m going to be making more of these outposts around the map, so I can fast travel and respawn.

When I got back to base, I did a little base organizing and dino rearranging. I also flew up to the mountain to harvest some crystal and metal. I found a red drop with a Primitive Compound Bow and Ramshackle Ghillie Boots. A quick tour of Pirate Cave showed potential for a future base. After harvesting some crystal and metal, I headed back to base, got the forges running, and crafted backup spyglasses. I need a beaver for building, so I flew to the mountains, spotting a cool blue Argy on the way.


![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 25 - Maverick the Argy!](/assets/img/first-25-days/Day-25-Maverick.jpg)

The sun starts to set as I fly over Viking Bay.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 25 - Sunset over Viking Bay!](/assets/img/first-25-days/survivordk-day-25-sunset.jpg)

It starts to get dark as I get to the Beaver pond. After a little searching, I find a level 145 female beaver with a cool stripe down her back. I quickly pick her up with Ace and fly back to base. During the night, I’m able to knock her out, but I accidentally shot one-too-many tranq arrows again! Oh well, it only dropped the taming effectiveness by about 10%, so I’m not gonna worry about it.

### Day 26: Taming an Awesome Argentavis

I was halfway to level 81 as the sun rose on day 26. I got some stone with Sandstone the Doedic then I harvested berries, thatch, and wood with Stacey the Stego. There’s plenty of bushes and trees just inland of my base. I’m able to harvest several stacks of Narcoberries with Stacey, then I start shuttling all the resources back to base.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 26 - Ace Level Up!](/assets/img/week-04/Day-26-Ace-Level-Up.jpg)

The morning was spent harvesting resources and crafting more stone structures. I built a trap next to my castle foundation for taming more creatures. After doing that, I saw a blue ring drop with a Journeyman sword in it. Nice! I also saw a purple drop, so I decided to check that one too. Inside was a frog saddle. When I got back to base, the beaver had woken up and was walking around. I picked her up and dropped her in the newly made trap. I start shooting tranq darts with my longneck rifle until I run out. Then I start crafting tranq arrow and switch to my crossbow. I knock out the beaver for the second time and start the taming process again. At least, I didn’t shoot that extra shot this time!

As the sun starts to set, I take Ace into the mountains to look for that high-level Argy. I find the Argy and quickly build captainfatdog’s Argy trap. Thanks again captainfatdog! You’re a legend!  It takes a while to lure the Argy into the trap since I’m not on a PT…

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 26 - Wild Blue Argy!](/assets/img/week-04/Day-26-Wild-Maverick.jpg)

I’m eventually successful, and I knock out the Argy as night falls on Day 26.

### Day 27: Capturing a Castoroides

The beaver woke up again last night! I need to craft more narcotic now.

On the morning of day 27, I hit level 82 after crafting some more stone structures. Then, I built a second trap so I can tame two creatures at once. I took Ace up into the mountains to search for another beaver. On the way, I decided to battle some mammoths for their pelt. I'm planning to craft fur armor soon to explore the Ice Cave and grab those loot crates for some awesome gear. I didn't get much pelt from the two mammoths I managed to kill, but that’s ok - I’ll get more later. When I arrived at the pond, there were tons of beavers, but they were zipping around so fast it took a while to find a high-level one. Finally, I spotted a level 145 male with an amazing red, green, and blue coat!

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 27 - Capturing a Castoroides!](/assets/img/week-04/Day-27-Another-Beaver.jpg)

On the way back to base, I saw a purple drop. Unfortunately, the two blueprints I got were a letdown. I picked up the beaver and brought him to the new trap. Now I have two high-level beavers ready for taming. I also spotted another purple drop, but it wasn't much better: a blueprint for some ghillie boots.

I checked on the knocked-out Argy and fed him some raw prime meat. Just around the corner, I found a pack of high-level raptors that I might tame after the beavers. They were guarding some crystal I needed, so I grabbed the couple nodes in the waterfall nearby. While harvesting some metal, I spotted a red drop.  This one was way better than those purple drops.  This one had actual armor in it, some Ramshackle Chitin Gauntlets! When I went to check on the Argy again, I didn't notice some scorpions sneaking up. They attacked the unconscious Argy, dropping its taming effectiveness to 20%. I decided to remove all the food from his inventory to let him wake up so I can try taming him again.


It's now 5 PM on Day 27. I'm going to craft some tranq darts to knock out those two beavers, and hopefully have some left over to re-knock out the Blue Argy, who I’m gonna name Maverick.  The evening was spent harvesting narcoberries and wood with Stacey.

### Day 28: Beavers and Base Building

Last night, I crafted a bunch of wooden and stone foundations for expanding my starter hut deck.  I’m going to build a small greenhouse next to my little bird barn for narcoberry and vegetable production. I placed a few standing torches around the base, and filled them up with some wood.  Next I expanded the deck around my little bird barn and starter hut.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 28 - Beach Base!](/assets/img/week-04/Day-28-Base-2.jpg)

After crafting some more tranq darts, I start knocking-out the two trapped beavers.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 28 - Trapped Beavers!](/assets/img/week-04/Day-28-Beavers-1.jpg)

My longneck rifle breaks after a few shots, which is good because I almost didn’t see a Theri sneaking into the base. The wild Theri almost killed my lowest-level Tek Parasaur! In order to repair the rifle, I need more metal ingots, so I take Thorny out to harvest some metal then I get forges running again. As the metal was smelting up, I spotted two blue drops, but both had very disappointing loot. When I return to base, I spot a wild Moschop roaming around wanting a rare flower. I pick one and successfully tame Poppy, my seventh Moschops. She lays large eggs, which I’ll be needing for my kibble farm. When I return to base, I finally knock out those two beavers. I spent the night crafting as much narcotic as I could to keep both these beavers unconscious. It would be awesome if they both tame up successfully!
