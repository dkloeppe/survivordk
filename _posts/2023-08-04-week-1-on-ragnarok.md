Hello and Welcome to my solo playthrough of Ark: Survival Evolved on the Ragnarok map.  Ark is an action-adventure, open-world, survival, crafting game where you can tame dinos, build bases, and fight bosses.  I started my YouTube channel ([@SurvivorDK](https://www.youtube.com/@SurvivorDK)) in 2023 because I enjoy playing this game and I wanted to learn video editing.  I have two main goals for my first Ragnarok series: tame every dino and beat the boss!  There are 110 tameable creatures on this map, so that's going to be quite the feat!  Additionally, I can fight the boss on three different difficulties: Gamma, Beta, and Alpha.  I want to beat all three! The boss on this map is a Dragon and Manticore!  I also have a third goal for my this series: I want to build bases all around the map.  This is going to help me complete my two main goals, and I really enjoy building!

## SurvivorDK’s First Week on Ragnarok: Taming, Building, and Exploring
Last week, I embarked on a fresh adventure on the stunning Ragnarok map. Starting on the shore of Viking Bay, I set out to harvest resources, tame some dinosaurs, and build a safe haven. Here's a detailed account of my first week in Ark, filled with exciting tames, resource gathering, and base building.

### Day 1: The Start of an Adventure

My journey began at Viking Bay 2, where I immediately started gathering essential resources. Right by the spawn point, I spotted two high-level Moschops. Moschops are passive tames with diverse dietary preferences, but luckily, these two wanted Mejoberries and Rare Flowers—both readily available on the beach.

As I waited for both Moschops to get hungry again, I put my first level into weight and unlocked the stone hatchet. I continued to harvest resources and explore the surrounding area until the taming process was complete. With Fire and Blue by my side, I moved up the beach, leveling up and gathering materials for a thatch hut.

I needed fiber, thatch, and wood to build my shelter for the night. Knowing that crates spawn in certain spots on the beach, I hoped to find some metal tools. While I didn't get the metal pickaxe or hatchet I wanted, I did find two crossbows and a pike—excellent additions to my inventory. I chose a nearby spot to set up camp and began building my thatch hut.

### Day 2: Expanding the Family

With my hut built, I took Fire out to gain some experience by fighting dinos. At sunrise, I knocked out some Dodos, planning to use their eggs to make basic kibble. By the end of the day, I had tamed two Moschops, three Dodos, one Dilo, and one Lystro. I also started taming another high-level female Moschops near the spawn point.

### Day 3: Slingshotting Trikes

On the morning of Day 3, I began upgrading my hut to wood and added more storage. At noon, I started using a slingshot to knock out a Trike right outside my hut. After repairing my slingshot a couple of times, I managed to knock out a different Trike that had aggroed on me. The rest of the day was spent harvesting stone and slingshotting Trikes and Turtles up and down the beach.

As the sun set on Day 3, I knocked out a Level 150 Female Turtle close to my hut. Before sunrise on Day 4, I tamed a Parasaur stuck in the trees near my base and led the Trikes back to camp.

### Day 4: Strengthening the Base

The morning of Day 4 saw the completion of my wood hut upgrade and the addition of a wood deck. In the afternoon, I tamed a Pego, who I named Leggo, and found a metal hatchet and sword in some crates. By the end of the day, I had reached level 24 and unlocked tranq arrows and stone building structures. I spent the night harvesting, crafting, and organizing my base.

### Day 5: Tools and Tames

On the morning of Day 5, I placed two forges, laid down a few stone foundations for the first barn, and set up a feeding trough. I also built a couple of large storage boxes, a smithy, and a ramp. By 10am, I walked the Level 150 Female Turtle back to base and prepared to use my newly crafted tranq arrows.

My first target was the Level 150 Female Trike I had spotted on Day 2. After knocking out the Trike, I returned to my hut to craft a metal pickaxe, planning to harvest a nearby crystal node to craft a spyglass. During this time, I spotted a Raptor on the beach and quickly crafted some bolas. After knocking out and feeding the Raptor, I headed back to the spawn area to tame a Tek Parasaur I had seen on Day 1.

By the end of Day 5, my base was home to three Moschops, five Dodos, one Dilo, one Lystro, three Trikes, one Turtle, one Parasaur, one Pego, one Tek Parasaur, and one Raptor.

### Days 6: More Tames and Upgrades

On Day 6, I set out to tame an Anky to start doing metal runs. On my way, I spotted an Iguanodon and a high-level Pteranodon. As the Anky tamed, I began tranqing a nearby max-level Stego until I ran out of ammo. This led to several trips back to base to craft more tranqs—a recurring theme in my adventures.

### Day 7: Finishing the Week Strong

Day 7 started with leading Thorny, my newly tamed Anky, back to base and doing my first metal run. My goal for the day was to tame the max-level Stego I had been trying to knock out. As the sun set, I finally knocked out the Stego in shallow water.

In the first week, I managed to tame twelve different species of dinos: Moschops, Dodo, Dilo, Lystro, Trike, Turtle, Parasaur, Pego, Tek Parasaur, Raptor, Iguanodon, and Anky. If successful, the Stego would be the thirteenth.

### Looking Ahead

Next week, I plan to focus on extensive building at the base, which means taming a Doedic for efficient stone gathering. Additionally, I aim to tame several Pteranodons now that I’ve unlocked the saddle at level 38. As of now, I'm level 39 and excited for the new possibilities.

I hope the Stego tames up without any issues. Thank you for following along on my journey! Please like, comment, and subscribe if you enjoyed this post, and I’ll see you tomorrow with more adventures!
