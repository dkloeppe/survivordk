Hello and Welcome!  I'm SurvivorDK, and I’m excited to share my latest adventure in Ark: Survival Evolved. Ark is an action-adventure, open-world, survival, crafting game.  You can tame dinos, build bases, and fight bosses!  I started a gaming YouTube channel in 2023 because I enjoy playing this game and I wanted to learn video editing.  There was a lot for me to learn, from recording with OBS, to fixing my audio in Audacity, to finding royalty-free-music, to editing in OpenShot and KDenLive, to actually playing the game and making progress!  I've really enjoyed every step of the way though!!  You can check out my SurvivorDK YouTube channel here: [YouTube.com/@SurvivorDK](https://www.youtube.com/@SurvivorDK)

## Starting My Ragnarok Adventure: Taming Moschops and Building a Thatch Hut
I spawned on the beautiful beach of Viking Bay, a perfect starting point for gathering resources and beginning my journey. Let’s dive into the details of my first day, where I tamed two high-level Moschops, explored the surroundings, and built a cozy thatch hut for the night.

### Harvesting Resources and Spotting Moschops

Upon spawning on the beach by Viking Bay, my first task was to start harvesting essential resources. As I gathered materials, I spotted two high-level Moschops right by the spawn point. This was a fantastic opportunity to get a head start with some strong tames.

### Taming Two Moschops: Fire and Blue

Moschops are passive tames that can require any of twenty different foods. Luckily, these two Moschops wanted Mejoberries and Rare Flowers, both of which can be found on the beach. I immediately began the taming process.

As I waited for the two Moschops, whom I'm going to name Fire and Blue, to get hungry again, I put my first level into weight and unlocked the stone hatchet. With my trusty stone hatchet, I continued harvesting resources and explored the surrounding area, keeping an eye on the two Moschops' taming progress.

### Exploring and Gathering Materials

After successfully taming Fire and Blue, I continued up the beach, leveling up and gathering more resources. I needed fiber, thatch, and wood to craft a thatch hut for shelter. Knowing that crates spawn on the beach in certain spots, I decided to search for them, hoping to find some useful metal tools.

### Crate Loot and Setting Up Camp

Unfortunately, I didn’t find the metal pickaxe or hatchet I was hoping for, but I did come across two crossbows and a pike—excellent finds that would undoubtedly help in my survival efforts. With these tools in hand, I picked a nearby spot on the beach to set up camp and began building my thatch hut.

### Building and Leveling Up

I built a simple 2x2 thatch hut as the sun set on Day 1. After constructing the hut, I took Fire out to fight some dinos and level up. This not only helped me gain valuable experience but also ensured that my Moschops was ready to face any threats that might come our way during the night.

This was just the beginning of my Ragnarok adventure. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to explore, build, and tame my way through Ark: Survival Evolved.
