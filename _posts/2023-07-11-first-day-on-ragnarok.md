I spawned on the beach by Viking Bay, a perfect starting point for gathering resources and beginning my journey.  After I gained my bearings, I did the most logical thing a survivor could do: start punching the nearest tree.  I harvested a few bushes and got my first level-up.  There are a ton of dodos around, and they are VERY noisy.  Don't they know I'm doing a Let's Play?  As I gathered materials under the Dodos' deafening roars, I spotted two high-level Moschops right by the spawn point. This was a fantastic opportunity to get a head start with some strong tames.

### Starting My Adventure: Taming Moschops

Moschops are passive tames that can require any of twenty different foods. Luckily, these two Moschops wanted Mejoberries and Rare Flowers, both of which can be found on the beach. I immediately began the taming process.

As I waited for the two Moschops, whom I'm going to name Fire and Blue, to get hungry again, I put my first level into weight and unlocked the stone hatchet. With my trusty stone hatchet, I continued harvesting resources and explored the surrounding area, keeping an eye on the two Moschops' taming progress.

Both Moschops required three feedings each to fully tame up, but I was lucky and they only wanted berries and rare flowers.  It would have been a real bummer if they wanted leech blood or something for their last feeding...

After successfully taming Fire and Blue, I continued up the beach, leveling up and gathering more resources. I needed fiber, thatch, and wood to craft a thatch hut for shelter. Knowing that crates spawn on the beach in certain spots, I decided to search for them, hoping to find some useful metal tools.

I mostly encountered safe dinos on the beach, like Lystros and Brontos, with the occasional Trike and Turtle.  I stuck close to the shoreline though, because I know there are some more dangerous spawns inland, like Raptors and Carnos and Rexes, Oh My!

### Exploring and Gathering Materials

As I explored the coast, I fought a few dilo and harvested them for hide and raw meat.  I also ran into a few compys but they were no match for Fire and Blue.  I did steer clear of an Argy though, I'm not looking for trouble just yet.  As I was making progress towards the spot where shipwrecked crates sometimes wash ashore, there was a thief lurking in the shadows...

A Pego lunges at Fire, stealing some narcoberries!  We follow the Pego off a cliff and successfully get the berries back.

I found the wooden crates on the beach on the evening of my first day on Ragnarok.  Unfortunately, I didn’t find the metal pickaxe or hatchet I was hoping for, but I did come across two crossbows and a pike—excellent finds that would undoubtedly help in my survival efforts. With these tools in hand, I picked a nearby spot on the beach to set up camp and began building my thatch hut.

### Building My Starter Hut

I built a simple 2x2 thatch hut as the sun set on Day 1. After constructing the hut, I took Fire out to fight some dinos and level up. This not only helped me gain valuable experience but also ensured that my Moschops was ready to face any threats that might come our way during the night.

This was just the beginning of my Ragnarok adventure. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to explore, build, and tame my way through Ark: Survival Evolved.
