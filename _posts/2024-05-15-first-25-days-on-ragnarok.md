Hello and Welcome!  I'm SurvivorDK, and this is my solo playthrough of Ark: Survival Evolved on the Ragnarok map.  This map is HUGE, and it has so many different biomes: beach, jungle, mountains, snow, redwoods, swamp, highlands, desert, ocean, caves, ruins, and more!  I have two main goals for my first series: tame every dino and beat the boss!  There are over a hundred tameable creatures on this map, so it's going to take a while.  Additionally, I want to beat the boss on all three difficulties: Gamma, Beta, and Alpha.  The boss on this map is a Dragon and Manticore!  My third goal for my this series is to build bases all around the map.  Accomplishing this will actually help me with achieving the other two goals.

### Week 1: Taming 20 Starter Dinos

During my first week on the beach by Viking Bay, I began gathering resources and started my journey as a survivor. I leveled up by harvesting bushes and punching trees, dealing with noisy Dodos along the way.

I spotted two high-level Moschops, named them Fire and Blue, and successfully tamed them with Mejoberries and Rare Flowers. As I continued exploring and gathering materials, I built a 2x2 thatch hut and searched for useful tools in crates along the beach, finding crossbows and a pike.

On Day 2, I tamed several Dodos for egg production and a Dilophosaur named Dary. I also tamed a Lystrosaurus named Peachy and a third Moschops named Beth. By the end of the day, my tames included three Moschops, four Dodos, one Dilo, and one Lystro.

On Day 3, I upgraded my hut to wood, added storage, and tamed a Trike and a Turtle. By Day 4, I completed the wood hut upgrade, added a deck, and found a metal hatchet and sword in crates. I reached level 24, unlocked tranq arrows, and crafted essential structures like forges and a smithy.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 5 - beach base](/assets/img/week-01/survivordk-day-5.jpg)

On Day 5, I tamed a high-level Trike, a Parasaur, a Tek Parasaur, and a Raptor. My base grew to include three Moschops, five Dodos, one Dilo, one Lystro, three Trikes, one Turtle, one Parasaur, one Pego, one Tek Parasaur, and one Raptor. Day 6 involved taming an Anky for metal runs and starting the process of taming a high-level Stego.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 7 - beach base](/assets/img/week-01/survivordk-day-7.jpg)

By the end of the week, my tribe included twelve different species, and I aimed to add the Stego as the thirteenth. My focus was on gathering resources, expanding my base, and building a safe haven for my growing collection of tamed creatures.

### Week 2: Taking Flight

I set out with Thorny to gather resources, as the sun rose on Day 8. My tribe now included 3 Moschops, 5 Dodos, 1 Dilo, 1 Lystro, 3 Trikes, 1 Turtle, 1 Parasaur, 1 Pego, 1 Tek Parasaur, 1 Raptor, 1 Iguanodon, and 1 Anky. I needed keratin for a pteranodon saddle, so I took Strawberry out for a hunt.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 8](/assets/img/week-02/Day8Wave.jpg)

While exploring, I found a Moschops and a green drop with valuable resources. After a chaotic mishap with a rare flower, I tamed several Moschops, bringing my total to 24 tamed dinos by nightfall.

Day 9 started with a metal run. I found a metal sickle and tamed two high-level Tek Parasaurs and a Pteranodon named Perry.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 10](/assets/img/week-02/Day10-Terry-Capture.jpg)

On Day 10, I hunted turtles for keratin and tamed Terry the Pteranodon and Phoebe the Phiomia. I also tamed Stacey the Stego and found a Ramshackle Simple Pistol.

With Stacey's help, I gathered more resources and tamed Sherry and Larry the Pteranodons, and a Tek Stego.

Day 11 involved more exploration and resource gathering. I tamed Berry the Pteranodon and Sparky the Tek Stego, preparing for future expeditions.

Day 12 started with crystal and obsidian gathering, but I died trying to tame a Doedicurus. After respawning far from home, I made a long trek back, crafted another pteranodon saddle, and avenged Leggo, my shoulder pet.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 13](/assets/img/week-02/Day13-Sunrise2.jpg)

As Day 13 dawned, I harvested resources and began building a stone barn. By morning, the barn was mostly complete, and I had leveled up to 53.

Despite the week's challenges, my tribe grew, and I prepared for greater adventures with my newly tamed fliers.

### Week 3: It's a Trap

On Day 15, I harvested berries with Stacey and crafted narcotics, longneck rifles, ammo, and flak armor. Thorny and I gathered flint and stone, preparing to tame a Level 85 Rex. I built a trap on the beach, named the Leggo Memorial Rex Trap, and successfully lured the Rex into it.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 15 - Rex Pillar Trap - @captainfatdog](/assets/img/week-03/Day-15-Rex-Trap-Cropped.jpg)

After repairing my crossbow mid-taming, I knocked out the Rex and fed it raw prime meat. He finished taming by the morning of Day 16, and I named him Cliff. I then tamed a Doedicurus that I named Sandstone. A purple drop provided me with some more blueprints, but nothing that I really wanted. I built an Argentavis trap and tamed Marge, a Level 100 Argy.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 17 - Taming an Argy!](/assets/img/week-03/Day-17-Argy-Trapped.jpg)

On Day 18, I aimed to tame a Doedicurus and an Argentavis. I found a level 130 Argy near the trap, started taming it, and reached level 66 while hunting for raw prime meat. 

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 18 - Taming an Argy!](/assets/img/week-03/Day-18-Argy.jpg)

A dangerous encounter with a Rex required backup from Cliff. I ended the day by knocking out a pink Level 60 Doedicurus on the beach. While waiting for the tames, I flew back to base to craft more tranqs, harvested stone and metal, gathered resources for cryopods, and collected Organic Polymer from penguins. Crafting three cryopods at Blue Obelisk marked a significant milestone, and I continued taming Ace the Argy while preparing for a Baryonyx. 

Day 19 was tough. While searching for a Baryonyx over the swamp, I accidentally dismounted mid-air and died.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 19 - First Death!](/assets/img/week-03/Day-19-Death-1-Dismount.jpg)

After respawning and flying back, I ignored Berry's stamina, leading to another fall and death near an Allo.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 19 - Second Death!](/assets/img/week-03/Day-19-Death-2-Stamina.jpg)

With no saddled fliers left, I rode Fire with Marge until I gathered enough Chitin to craft an Argy saddle.After crafting an Argy saddle, I retrieved my death bags and trapped the Baryonyx, eventually taming it.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 20 - Taming a Baryonyx!](/assets/img/week-03/Day-20-Baryonyx.jpg)

On Day 21, I tamed a Frog. I was able to knock him out next to the Baryonyx trap that I built yesterday.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 20 - Taming a Frog!](/assets/img/week-03/Day-21-Frog.jpg)

I flew back to base, crafted saddles, and planned to build a castle on the coast!

Here's the full movie for week 3: [![Taming a Rex, Argy, Doedic, and Bary!](/assets/img/week-03/survivordk-week-3-thumbnail.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV9nwMeW9V8&t=3617s)

### Day 22: Treasure Hunting and Expanding my Base

On the morning of Day 22, I set off towards the swamp to pick up the frog. On the way, I set up a respawn outpost near the Rex and Argy traps. I also set up a respawn outpost in the swamp by the Bary trap. I brought Billy the Frog back to base!

Here’s the shape of the castle that I’d like to build:

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 22 - Castle Foundation Shape!](/assets/img/first-25-days/Base-Sketch.jpg)

I’m building it up on the ledge overlooking my starter hut, and I’m going to build stairs up to the foundation’s edge. I’m going to use large stone walls all around the perimeter, with three stone dinosaur gateways. The second level is going to have a hole in the middle so I can fly in and out of the base. Eventually the six towers may go up to third and fourth levels. To start, it’s gonna require over 23,000 Stone, 11,000 Wood, and 8,000 Thatch. Today, I’m only going to start placing some of the foundations though.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 22 - Castle Foundation Start!](/assets/img/first-25-days/Day-22-Thumb.jpg)

I was only able to place about a fifth of the foundations before running out of materials. The castle foundation is 192 triangle stone foundations and 48 square stone foundations. I decided to go check out the sunken ship in Viking Bay! I don’t have any scuba gear crafted yet, but I’m curious.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 22 - Sunken Ship in Viking Bay!](/assets/img/first-25-days/Day-22-ship.jpg)

There were several Megalodons and Sea Scorpions guarding the treasure, so I decided to head back to base as the sun set on day 22.

Here's the full episode for day 22: [![Expanding the Base!](/assets/img/first-25-days/Day-22-Thumbnail.jpg)](https://youtu.be/4E0IthuZ23c)

### Day 23: Castle Foundation

Last night, I spotted a purple drop. Inside I found a ghillie mask. Nice! When I got back to base, I spotted a pt egg, but I was blocked! All my dinos are getting a little crowded around my starter hut. It’ll be nice when I move most of the dinos up to the castle. I need to re-organize my base a bit, it’s starting to affect my efficency, but today, I want to make more progress on the castle foundation!

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 23 - Sunrise on an Argy!](/assets/img/first-25-days/Day-23-Sunrise-Argy.jpg)

I want to craft some scuba gear before I go back to explore the sunken ship in Viking Bay! In order to do that, I’ll need to make a fabricator. Most of the morning was spent crafting foundations.  I harvested a lot of stone with Garnet the Doedicurus! I kept placing foundations down, slowly making my way around the perimeter.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 23 - Castle Foundation Perimeter!](/assets/img/first-25-days/Day-23-base-screenshot.jpg)

I also crafted a bunch of sparkpower and gunpowder, and a little narcotic. Eventually I was able to finish the outer ring of the castle foundation. I only have the center portion left: 24 square and 48 triangle stone foundations. I’m 70% done with the foundation!

Here's the full episode for day 23: [![Castle Foundation!](/assets/img/first-25-days/Day-23-Thumbnail.jpg)](https://youtu.be/T5138vuMHrc)

### Day 24: Swamp Misadventures

I struggled with building the ramp up to my castle.  I need to place stone stairs, ceilings, and pillars, but it’s a little finicky.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 24 - Castle Entrance Stairs!](/assets/img/first-25-days/Day-24-stairs.jpg)

I give up on it for a bit and decide to go back to the swamp to look for another Baryonyx. I stopped by the Leggo Memorial Rex Trap to pick up Sandstone. I want to have BOTH Doed’s back at base for building. After doing that, I continued flying south towards the swamp. When I got to the swamp, I expanded the trap that I had built. I also placed down a second trap next to it, now I can tame two creatures at once!

As I was flying around looking for a high-level Bary, I spotted an awesome green level 145 Frog.  I picked her up and flew her over to one of the traps. I unsuccessfully dropped the frog into the trap several times before finally just doing it on foot.  As I’m tranqing the trapped frog, I mess up the last shot and it drops the taming effectiveness a little.  I decided to let the frog wake up, so I could try again.  I’m hoping for some good stats on this one.

I continued flying around, looking for a Baryonyx. After doing a loop around the entire swamp, I finally spotted a Level 95 Male Baryonyx. I was contemplating luring him over to the trap, but I accidentally put my Argy in the water.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 24 - Epic Fail in the swamp while looking for a high-level Baryonyx!](/assets/img/first-25-days/Day-24-Epic-Fail.jpg)

I’m killed by a Kapro in the panic of my disastrous dismount.  I should really craft myself a pump shotty!

I respawned at a nearby bed and began my death run attempts back to my bag. After failing several times, I decided to respawn back at base and make the journey again. I take Terry all the way back to the Swamp and successfully collect all of my bags and Ace!  Ace had taken out the Bary, so I won’t be taming that level 95.  I’m hoping for at least level 135 anyways, so I’ll keep looking…

Here's the full episode for day 24: [![How do I Build a Ramp!](/assets/img/first-25-days/Day-24-Thumbnail-v2.jpg)](https://youtu.be/CnrJCfk5h40)

### Day 25: Taming a Beaver

I start re-tranqing the frog, this time being careful not to shoot that extra shot. It’s a little before sunrise, so it’s still quite dark. I need to place some standing torches or campfires around the traps.  Then I’ll be able to see better. I harvested some raw prime meat from a Paracer, then I fed it to the knocked-out frog. The frog tamed up to level 217! I’m pretty happy with the stats. Health and Melee went up quite a bit, and Movement Speed doubled! Lilly’s gonna be a great frog to take caving! I found an decent frog saddle in a purple drop on Day 17.

I left a bunch of supplies in a crate by my swamp bed. Now I can fast-travel over to the swamp and have some gear. Or use it as a spare kit if I die, which will probably happen eventually. The swamp is pretty dangerous.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 25 - Lilly the Frog!](/assets/img/first-25-days/Day-25-Lilly-the-Frog.jpg)

At 5am on Day 25, I brought Lilly back to base. I’ve also got a crate by my bed at the Leggo Memorial Rex Trap. It has a few tools and a PT. I would like to make more of these stashes around the map, with beds so I can fast travel and respawn.

When I got back to base, I did a little base organizing and dino rearranging. I also flew up to the mountain to harvest some crystal and metal. I spotted a red drop, so I flew over to check it out. Inside, I found a Primitive Compound Bow and Ramshackle Ghillie Boots. I also got a blueprint for an Apprentice Chitin Helmet.

I did a quick flying tour of Pirate Cave. I’d like to build a little base here at some point. I also want to tame an otter soon. When I got back to base, I got the forges running and crafted a couple backup spyglasses.

I have an idea on how to finish the ramp, but I need to craft some structures first. A beaver is really going to help me with building, so I’m going to fly a little further up into the mountains to find one. On the way, I spot a really cool blue Argy.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 25 - Maverick the Argy!](/assets/img/first-25-days/Day-25-Maverick.jpg)

The sun starts to set as I fly over Viking Bay.

![Ark Ragnarok - SurvivorDK Day 25 - Sunset over Viking Bay!](/assets/img/first-25-days/survivordk-day-25-sunset.jpg)

It starts to get dark as I get to the Beaver pond. After a little searching, I find a level 145 female beaver with a cool stripe down her back. I quickly pick her up with Ace and fly back to base. During the night, I’m able to knock her out, but I accidentally shot one-too-many tranq arrows again! Oh well, it only dropped the taming effectiveness by about 10%, so I’m not gonna worry about it.

Well, that’s it for my first 25 days on Ragnarok!
