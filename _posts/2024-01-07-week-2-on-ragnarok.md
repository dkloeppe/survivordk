Welcome to my solo playthrough of Ark: Survival Evolved on the expansive Ragnarok map. My goals for this series are ambitious: taming all 110 creatures, defeating the bosses on all three difficulties (Gamma, Beta, and Alpha), and building bases across the diverse biomes.

During my first week, I focused on gathering resources and taming various dinosaurs to build a safe haven. I tamed two high-level Moschops and named them Fire and Blue. I also scavenged crates, finding crossbows and a pike, which significantly boosted my early game arsenal. The first day ended with my basic hut completed and an exploration session to gather more experience. Next, I tamed some Dodos for egg production and a Dilophosaur that I named Dary. As the week progressed, I upgraded my hut to wood and added essential structures. By day 5, my base had forges and a smithy, and I had expanded my tribe with Trikes, a Turtle, a Parasaur, a Pego named Leggo, a Tek Parasaur, and Strawberry the Raptor. I also tamed an Anky for metal runs and aimed to tame a max-level Stego, bringing my total to twelve different species by the week's end. If successful, the Stego will be the thirteenth kind of dino.  Now, it's Week 2 on Ragnarok, and I'm thrilled to share my adventures of taming my first fliers!

### Day 8: A New Dawn

The sun rose on day 8, casting a warm glow over my thatch hut on the beach. I set out with Thorny to gather flint, stone, and metal. My growing tribe included 3 Moschops, 5 Dodos, 1 Dilo, 1 Lystro, 3 Trikes, 1 Turtle, 1 Parasaur, 1 Pego, 1 Tek Parasaur, 1 Raptor, 1 Iguanodon, and 1 Anky. Determined to find keratin for a pteranodon saddle, I took Strawberry out for a hunt.

While exploring, I stumbled upon a Moschops and a green drop containing valuable resources and 8 narcotic. I decided to tame a level 130 female Moschops but accidentally ate a rare flower, causing chaos. Once the effect wore off, I tamed Lavender, Sandy, Blaze, and finally Marigold. By nightfall, I had 24 tamed dinos back at base.

### Day 9: My First Flier

I began the day with a metal run, ensuring the forges were loaded. After crafting large storage boxes, I took Iggs out to harvest narcoberries and found a metal sickle in a purple drop. Eager to expand my tribe, I took Strawberry out and spotted two high-level Tek Parasaurs near the base. After taming Sapphire and Topaz, I turned my attention to a level 90 Pteranodon, taming Perry, my first flier.

### Day 10: More Fliers

At dawn, I hunted turtles for keratin, managing to gather 21, almost a third of what I needed for a saddle. On my way back, I tamed Terry the Pteranodon and Phoebe the Phiomia.

I also tamed Stacey the Stego and found a Ramshackle Simple Pistol in a blue ring drop. I spent the night crafting bullets and narcotics, preparing for the next day's adventures.

### Day 11: Hunting for Keratin

Stegos are fantastic at gathering wood, thatch, and berries. With Stacey's help, I harvested until she was over-encumbered. I then took Thorny out for more flint, metal, and stone. In the afternoon, I tamed Sherry the Pteranodon and gathered enough keratin to craft a pteranodon saddle. As the sun set, I managed to tame Larry the Pteranodon and a Tek Stego, ending the day on a high note.

### Day 12: A Flier's Freedom

Exploration and resource gathering defined day 12. I tamed Berry the Pteranodon and Sparky the Tek Stego, bringing my total to 16 different kinds of creatures. As the sun set, I continued to expand my base, preparing for future expeditions.

### Day 13: Thorny and Spikey

Day 13 began with me exploring on Terry, gathering crystal and obsidian. I attempted to tame a Doedicurus but fell to my death in the process. Without a bed, I respawned far from home and had to make a long trek back. During my journey, I crafted another pteranodon saddle and retrieved my gear. I avenged Leggo, my shoulder pet, who had fallen to a Dilophosaur, and returned to base with Terry, ready to face new challenges.

### Day 14: The Fall and the Return

As dawn broke on day 14, I harvested wood and other resources with Stacey and Thorny. I began constructing a small stone barn, working through the night. By morning, the barn was mostly complete, and I had leveled up to 53, improving my stats to better survive the harsh environment.

Despite the ups and downs of the week, I made significant progress. My tribe had grown, and I was ready to take to the skies with my newly tamed fliers. With each challenge, I learned and adapted, preparing for even greater adventures ahead.
