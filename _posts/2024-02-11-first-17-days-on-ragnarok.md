Hello and Welcome!  I'm SurvivorDK, and I play Ark: Survival Evolved (2015).  Ark is an action-adventure, open-world, survival, crafting game.  I started this channel in 2023 because I enjoy playing this game and I wanted to learn video editing.  So far, I've made 27 videos, and I've gotten 7 subscribers!  There was a lot for me to learn, from recording with OBS, to fixing my audio in Audacity, to finding royalty-free-music, to editing in OpenShot and KDenLive, to actually playing the game and making progress!  I've really enjoyed every step of the way though!!

I spawned on the beach by Viking Bay and was able to tame two high-level Moschops.  I made my way up the beach and found some wooden crates washed up on the shore.  Inside, I found a metal hatchet and a pike.  I set up camp nearby on the beach as the sun set on day 1.

Over the course of my first week on Ragnarok, I tamed 12 different kinds of creatures: Moschops, Dodo, Dilo, Lystro, Trike, Turtle, Parasaur, Pego, Tek Parasaur, Raptor, Iguanodon, and Anky.  My base on the beach was continuing to expand as I leveled up and unlocked more engrams (crafting recipes).  There are still many harvesting dinos that I need to tame to speed up my building, but mainly a Doedicurus!

During my second week on Ragnarok, I tamed my first fliers!  Taming Pteranodons and unlocking their saddle is a huge accomplishment.  Now I'm able to explore the map faster and safer than before.  They can't carry as much as an Argy, but they're much faster!

On day 15, I built a Captain Fatdog Stone Pillar Rex Trap.  You can check out his video here: [Captain Fatdog's Rex Trap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsMAP97SYCs).  Captain Fatdog designed a bunch of traps that are really easy to use.  You can check out his YouTube channel here: [@captainfatdog](https://www.youtube.com/@captainfatdog).  The Rex trap only uses 14 stone pillars, and I was able to trap a level 85 Rex on the first try!  I haven't unlocked the saddle engram yet (I'm too low level), and I had to destroy one pilar to get him out of the trap (I don't have Cryopods yet).  He'll be great security to have on the beach though!

On day 16, I'm finally able to tame a Doedicurus!  Doedics are able to harvest a lot of stone.  No more harvesting stone with Ankys!

On day 17, I craft another one of Captain Fatdog's traps.  His Argentavis trap is super cheap to build.  You can check out his video here: [Captain Fatdog's Argy Trap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sibYbwkn3ys&t=0s).  The trap worked perfectly, and I was able to tame my first Argentavis.

On day 18, I would like to craft an Argy saddle and some Cryopods.  Additionally, I'll be looking for more creatures to tame.  Thank you for stopping by!
