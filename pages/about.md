Hello and Welcome! I'm SurvivorDK, and I play Ark: Survival Evolved solo on Ragnarok.  Ark is an action-adventure, open-world, survival, crafting game where you can tame dinos, build bases, and fight bosses.  The game was developed by Studio Wildcard in 2015.  I purchased the game on Steam.  Here's the link: [Steam Link for ARK: Survival Evolved](https://store.steampowered.com/app/346110/ARK_Survival_Evolved/)

I started my YouTube channel ([@SurvivorDK](https://www.youtube.com/@SurvivorDK)) in 2023 because I enjoy playing this game and I wanted to learn video editing.  There was a lot for me to learn, from recording with OBS, to fixing my audio in Audacity, to finding royalty-free-music, to editing in OpenShot and KDenLive, to actually playing the game and making progress!  I've really enjoyed every step of the way though!!

I have three main goals for my first Ragnarok series: tame every dino, beat the boss, and build epic bases!  There are 110 tameable creatures on this map, so that's going to be quite the feat!  Additionally, I can fight the boss on three different difficulties: Gamma, Beta, and Alpha.  I want to beat all three! The boss on this map is a Dragon and Manticore!
