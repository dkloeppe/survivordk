[![Welcome to @SurvivorDK](/assets/img/week-02/survivordk-welcome-2.png)](https://www.youtube.com/@SurvivorDK)

I play on PC with a keyboard & mouse.  I don't play with any mods or boosted settings, just vanilla 1X.

PC specs:
- MSI MPG X570 Gaming Edge WiFi Motherboard
- Ryzen 5 5600X 6-core 3.7 GHz Processor w/ Hyper 212 tower air cooler
- XFX Speedster MERC319 AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT 16GB GDDR6 Graphics Card
- G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series 64GB (4 x 16GB) DDR4 RAM
- EVGA SuperNova G3 1000W 80+ Gold PSU
- Samsung 980 PRO 500GB M.2 SSD

I'd like to upgrade my cpu to a Ryzen 5 5800X3D with a liquid cooler.  I'm currently using an inexpensive usb mic, but I'll upgrade to a nicer one at some point!  I also really need to upgrade my storage...  That Samsung 990 PRO 4TB looks awesome!
